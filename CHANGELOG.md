# AdmStorm Changelog

## [Unreleased]

New KPHP Playground, automatic push to the server after a commit, generation of builders directly in the IDE, new
options for synchronizing autogenerated files, and other minor improvements and fixes.

### Added

- New KPHP Playground, now it does not depend on repository files and will not interfere with pushing to Gitlab;
- An automatic action in notifications about the inability to connect via SSH, which resets the Yubikey and connects
  again;
- Added new action `Execute Selected in Playground` to the editor context menu, now you can create a new KPHP Playground
  from selected piece of code;
- Added commit and push to Gitlab button in the commit window;
- Now, after creating a commit, it is automatically pushed to the development server;
- Added a new run configuration for generating builders with automatic download of modified files;
- Added Hastebin from selected text only;
- Added new action `Sync Autogenerated Files` to the `Tool | server`, which makes it easy to sync autogenerated files
  after executing some command on server.

  > If the file was deleted on the server, it will be deleted locally as well.

### Other improvements

- Improved file sync dialog;
  - Files are now displayed sorted (by state);
  - For files that are only in the local repository, added the ability to delete them;
  - Now the full path to the file is displayed starting from `~/`;
  - Now after clicking the button to download a file from the server, it will be started immediately, and not after
    closing the dialog;
  - Now if the file is located only locally or only on the server, when viewing its contents, it will be displayed in a
    simple viewer, and not in a diff viewer with two editors;
  - Fixed a bug when deleting a file from the list, the focus did not go to the next one, and it was necessary to select
    the file manually.

### Fixed

- Fixed `AlreadyDisposedException` when closing a project and opening other projects. Also thanks to this, now when
  switching projects, the synchronization check does not break when focusing on the IDE;
- Fixed a bug with slashes during file synchronization for Windows users;
- Fixed a bug where, during KPHP execution, closing one tab would close another;
- Fixed a bug when launching PHPUnit from an icon created new duplicate configurations.
