improvements and fixes.

### Added

- New KPHP Playground, now it does not depend on repository files and will not interfere with pushing to Gitlab;
- Action `Execute Selected in Playground` to the editor context menu, now you can create a new KPHP Playground from
  selected piece of code;
- Action in notifications about the inability to connect via SSH, which resets the Yubikey and connects again;
- Commit and push to Gitlab button in the commit window;
- Now, after creating a commit, it is automatically pushed to the development server;
- Run configuration for generating builders with automatic download of modified files;
- Hastebin from selected text only;
- Action `Sync Autogenerated Files` to the `Tool | server`, which makes it easy to sync autogenerated files after
  executing some command on server.

  > If the file was deleted on the server, it will be deleted locally as well.

### Other improvements

- Improved file sync dialog;
    - Files are now displayed sorted (by state);
    - For files that are only in the local repository, added the ability to delete them;
    - Now the full path to the file is displayed starting from `~/`;
    - Now after clicking the button to download a file from the server, it will be started immediately, and not after
      closing the dialog;
    - Now if the file is located only locally or only on the server, when viewing its contents, it will be displayed in
      a simple viewer, and not in a diff viewer with two editors;
    - Fixed a bug when deleting a file from the list, the focus did not go to the next one, and it was necessary to
      select the file manually.

### Fixed

- `AlreadyDisposedException` when closing a project and opening other projects. Also thanks to this, now when switching
  projects, the synchronization check does not break when focusing on the IDE;
- Bug with slashes during file synchronization for Windows users;
- Bug when, during KPHP execution, closing one tab would close another;
- Bug when launching PHPUnit from an icon created new duplicate configurations.
